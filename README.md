My personal mission is to solve unknown problems with unknown solutions, I thrive in environments where I can throw myself into uncharted territories and emerge with solutions, learning technologies and techniques. I love coding and working on some form of project every day, I think it makes my life meaningful to know that somebody else will build upon the technology just like I did as well!

Outside of coding, you’ll find me drumming, playing guitar, or performing in theater productions. I’m always blending my love for creativity and technology.
